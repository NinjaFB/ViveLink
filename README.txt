WIP Java mod to add command functionality to Vivecraft.
-------------------------------------------
Current and planned commands:
/vr isvr [name]
*/vr getvec [name]
*/vr getpos [name
(* = not fully implemented)
Use:
==============================
All commands are started with /vr.
When no name is specified, all commands will default to the user.
"/vr isvr" by default will return the vr status of a player, whether that be in vr or not in vr.
