# WIP Java mod to add command functionality to Vivecraft.
-------------------------------------------
## Current and planned commands:<br>
    /vr isvr [name]
    /vr getrot [name]
    /vr getpos (hmd|main|off) [name]

## Use:
All commands are started with /vr, and when no name is specified, all commands will default to the user.<br><br>
"/vr isvr" by default will return the vr status of a player, whether that be in vr or not in vr.<br><br>
"/vr getrot" by default will return the exact rotation in the order of Pitch, Yaw, and Roll. <br><br>
"/vr getpos" by default will return the exact position of a specified device.
